 * The Binary Search Performs its search Operation on Sorted Array
 * by starting at the middle Index and Splits the Half of the Array(Changes the Position of Middle value)
 * if target is less than the Middle value Then left half is considered.
 * target is greater than the Middle value Then Right half is Considered.
 * The Time Complexity for BinarySearch is O(log n)
 * The BinarySearch Performance will be Efficient when used with Large data 
 * 
 * The BinarySearch has A default method in the Arrays.binarySearch(can be multiple inputs);
